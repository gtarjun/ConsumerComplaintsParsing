The federal government provides a way for consumers to file complaints against companies regarding different financial products, such as payment problems with a credit card or debt collection tactics. This algorithm is about identifying the number of complaints filed and how they're spread across different companies.

This project takes all Consumer Complaints data and parses it based on for each financial product and year, the total number of complaints, number of companies receiving a complaint, and the highest percentage of complaints directed at a single company.
